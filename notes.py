# --> for making empty set in python we use 
setname = set()  #this implies setname is a set
# whereas setname_2 = {}  implies this is a dictionary


# --> for checking subset and proper subset
# A = {1, 2}
# B = {1, 2, 3}
# print(A <= B)    Output: True , subset 
# print(A < B)    Output: True , proper subset 


# --> else with for loop is only executed when for loop is fully executed without any break
